**Exercise 1 -                               Variable Updating**

What will the following code produce?

a = 2
a = 4
a = 6
print(a + a + a)

Hints:
Python reads and executes scripts from top to bottom


Answer: 

18  

Explanation: 

The script would output 18  in the command line. Below is the explanation. 
Since Python reads and executes scripts from top to bottom, variable a  will be updated in every line until line 3 where a  finally gets the value of 6 . Then the print  function prints out 6 + 6 + 6  which is 18 .
